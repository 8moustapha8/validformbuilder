ValidForm Builder
================

The ValidForm Builder is a PHP and JavaScript library that simplifies the often tedious creation of standards based web forms. Correct field validation of forms is an often overlooked problem and can lead to serious security issues. Building a form and adding validation to it was never that easy.
